# Setting Up EmailJS for Contact Form

To make the contact form send emails to your personal email address, you need to set up EmailJS. Follow these steps:

## 1. Create an EmailJS Account

Go to [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) and sign up for a free account.

## 2. Create an Email Service

1. In your EmailJS dashboard, go to "Email Services" and click "Add New Service"
2. Choose your email provider (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
3. Follow the instructions to connect your email account
4. Note down the **Service ID** that is generated

## 3. Create an Email Template

1. Go to "Email Templates" and click "Create New Template"
2. Design your email template. You can use these variables in your template:
   - `{{from_name}}` - The name of the person who submitted the form
   - `{{from_email}}` - The email of the person who submitted the form
   - `{{message}}` - The message content
   - `{{to_email}}` - Your email address
3. Save the template and note down the **Template ID**

## 4. Get Your Public Key

1. Go to "Account" > "API Keys"
2. Copy your **Public Key**

## 5. Update Your Code

Replace the placeholders in your code with the actual values:

1. Open `components/contact.tsx`
2. Replace `YOUR_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY` with your actual Public Key
3. Replace `YOUR_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID` with your Service ID
4. Replace `YOUR_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID` with your Template ID

That's it! Your contact form should now send emails to your personal email address when users submit the form.
